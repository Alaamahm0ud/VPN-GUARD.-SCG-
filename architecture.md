# 🧩 VPN GUARD (SCG) — System Architecture

## Overview
VPN GUARD (SCG) is a modular cybersecurity platform designed to ensure secure, adaptive, and ethical network protection.  
The system is structured with multiple layers for isolation, control, and intelligent decision-making, ensuring zero data exposure and full transparency.

## 🏗️ Architecture Layers

### 1. Core Layer
- Handles encryption/decryption processes.
- Manages VPN tunnel integrity and data flow.
- Integrates adaptive routing and connection watchdog.

### 2. Control Layer
- Responsible for monitoring connections and session health.
- Detects anomalies, packet leaks, and untrusted processes.
- Implements behavioral scoring and adaptive responses.

### 3. Intelligence Layer
- Uses local AI modules for decision-making.
- Analyzes patterns of threats and predicts attacks.
- Operates completely offline (no external AI APIs).

### 4. Interface Layer
- Provides command-line and graphical control.
- Displays live analytics, reports, and session logs.
- Accessible locally, protected by role-based control.

## 🔐 Isolation & Data Flow
Each component runs in its own secure sandbox, communicating only through verified internal APIs.  
Sensitive data (keys, routes, logs) never leaves the device or connects to external networks.
